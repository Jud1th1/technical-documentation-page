## Overview

The Technical Documentation Page is a project that presents API documentation in a structured and user-friendly format. The page is built to provide a clear, responsive interface for developers to navigate the documentation easily. It includes a side navigation bar, multiple sections covering different aspects of the API, and practical code examples.

### The challenge

As part of a FreeCodeCamp project, the primary challenge was to build a technical documentation page that ensures a well-organized layout and is responsive across devices. I aimed to create a fixed side navigation bar that remains accessible at all times and links to specific sections of the documentation.

## My process

1. **Understanding the Requirements**: I followed the FreeCodeCamp project guidelines and tested my knowledge from previous practice sessions. The goal was to create a page that met specific user stories, including a fixed navigation bar, responsive design, and media queries.

2. **Design and Layout**: I designed the page to feature a simple layout, with a navigation bar that remains fixed on the left side. Each section is well-defined, and headers link back to the navigation for easy reference. Each section of the documentation provides detailed explanations, code examples, and lists. I ensured proper HTML structure with headers, paragraphs, and code blocks. The CSS for the code blocks required some tedious adjustments, but I’m pleased with the final result, which allowed me to practice my CSS skills further.

3. **Building the Navigation Bar**: I developed a responsive navbar with links to each section. I wanted it to adjust for mobile screens, where the navbar becomes a hamburger menu for a better user experience. With further development I I plan to add a “back to top” button and make the hamburger icon fixed so that it remains visible as users scroll.

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- Responsive Design (Media Queries)

### What I learned

Throughout the development of this technical documentation page, I got to revisit some previous things I learned, such as:

- **Responsive Layout**: I improved my understanding of how to make layouts responsive using media queries and Flexbox, especially for side navigation.

- **JavaScript for Navigation**: Learned how to implement a hamburger menu using JavaScript to toggle the side navigation for mobile devices.

## Continued Development

- **Search Functionality**: Implementing a search bar to allow users to quickly find relevant sections or terms within the documentation.

- **Expand to Full API Documentation**: Expand the project to include a fully functional API with interactive examples.
